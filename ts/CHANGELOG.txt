! Feature fixed/updated
? Unresolved issue
* Note

Version 2.1.21 beta - aug 19 2005

Morfeo:
+new armor behaviour (kevlar is always on and cannot be dropped if bought, it always absorb some ammount of damage, 20% by default)
+semi-custom lasersight color (cl_lasercolor 0, 1 or 2)
!slowpause to 2 sec
!throwing sealknives do 35 damage
+new particle sys features: follow axis and stretching along velocity (both useful for rain, look at the fgd)
!some better particle sparks effect
+new infinite clip model
+new beretta/skorpion sounds (thx flakk)

Version 2.1.20 beta - aug 4 2005

+some ts_emitter entities optimization
+ Refactored placeable powerups: 
Its now possible to spwan any random set of powerups (slwmo+slowpause, grenades+infite+double firerate, all of them, just one, you name it). 
Its also possible to have some powerups with custom duration time (6 sec slowmo for example).
!some animation improvements (feet sliding with melee)
!view bob tweaked
!lasersight: now with animated beam (still to polish), gameplay wise it grant a little more accuracy for the very first shots.
!fixed weirdo stock attack bug
!all the weapon default values updated to the latest weapon config

Version 2.1.19 beta - July 11 2005
Vino:
+All client-side messages are now localized. Server-side messages require more work.

Morfeo:
!several melee changes: the biggest one is regarding blocking, each melee weapon can block and is using the melee bar now. The more you block the more you eat the bar, the less the bar is the less the damage you do. Once the bar reach 0 it will take a while to block again. Whenever you block you always block the full damage.
+contender scope
+laser beam visible from thirdperson
!scope sprite is less obstructing now
+wrong torso rotation for kungfu and melee weapons when running is adjusted automatically by code. Finally!
+ts_emitters/ts_particle changes: offset origin can be defined only in the emitter, and added the "particles around camera" feature (in the ts_emitter look for "Density around camera" and "Camera radius", the first (0-1 range) define how much of the particles will be inside the defined radius)
+new infinite clips behaviour, it will double the current weapon clip now (very precius powerup now)
!a better jump feeling and some smoothness to the camera rolling
!network code improvement: weapon clip/firemode update is done completely client side! And player accel is calcuated by the maxspeed, no need to synch it anymore.
!fixed missing slowmotion when turn spectator
!small tracers tweaking
-removed viewpunch due bullet damage


Version 2.1.18 beta - May 5 2005
!The one mode works again and it should more solid now.
!no more extra frags for backwheeling on the spot.
!katana progress: 50hp for strong, 25hp for light, only back and duck attacks stops the player, firerates tweaked.
!kungfu selectable again in the weapon menu only via slot keys (next/prev weapon commands ignore kungfu)
!max particles count doubled
!a way better/cheaper/serious bullet trail effect (no more silly "enter the matrix" trails): basically we have tracers in slowmotion now. And the less the slowmotion the more they are stretched.

Version 2.1.17 beta - May 1 2005

Vino:
+Added a bar on the right of each weapon in the menu to show remaining ammo for that weapon.
!Fixed cl_showequipment display for empty weapons not showing up red.
!Fixes for gl_fog
!Demos show alternate fire animations and globalslow effects correctly.
!Improved demo recording a playback.
!Disallow stocking while zoomed.
!Fixed logs not showing what people say.
!Fixed crash which occurred when you prime a grenade and then drop it.
!Fixed disarming of accumulable weapons disarming the entire set of weapons. (morf: actually, I dont consider that a bug)

Morfeo:
+skorpion added!!1
+disarm by accumulative damage, melee weapons takes more damage to get disarmed
+work in progress on the katana revamp: damages are totally wrong
!only 1 extra frag for stunting

Version 2.1.16 beta - Apr 16 2005
!fixed jumping/fu bar bug
!a way better spread pattern
+armor values are saved/loaded from the weapon config
+carried weapons are shown on the hud (optional with cl_showequipment cvar, or from the customize menu)
!several animation improvements (dives, walljump, knife anims, etc..)
!removed kungfu from the selection menu (just slot0 switch to kungfu)
+added "botarmor" cvar: -1 = never buy armor, 0 = random, 1 = always buy armor
+knives will be dropped in packs now, this means you dont have to press the drop button 10 times if you want to get rid of your knives. I expect an extra w_model for when they are packed.

Version 2.1.15 beta - Apr 3 2005
!gunkick disarm restored
!A key buy the contender (doesnt feel that good anyway, probably its better to put the contender in the special category..)
!kelvar is by default
+also in teamDM there can be 4 teams max, each team with arbitrary names and models!
+updated FGD with more spawn spots, one for each team. So its possible to define specific spawn spots even in simple teamDM.
+grenade can be thrown back by pressing USE!!1
!restored old secondary attack for the grenade
!fixed grenade switching bug
!added cl_thirdtransparency and cl_motionblur, also accessible from customize menu

Version 2.1.14 beta - Mar 25 2005

!test: trying black fade instead blue for slowmotion
!weapon selection should be fixed once for all

+ origin offset moved from ts_particle to ts_emitter, the one in ts_particle is still supported for a while until mappers update their maps.

! safe collision for particles, which means that no collision is missed even with big delays between the collision checks.

+ support for katana and knife idles
+ support for basic briefcase animations (but still need some work, and I'm still skeptical about it: briefcase limit a lot the player freedom)

! Fixed the screen flashing red for damages less then 1.
! Fixed selecting an empty weapon slot switching you to kung fu.
! Fixed Morfeo's fix of the fu script blocking system (cl_pitchspeed would never be less then 225. Now will never be more. :D)

! Fixed hud weapon selection menu switching to the weapon which just finished reloading.
! Fixed weapon reload twice if the button is held down.
! Fixed not being able to dive if you jump off something.

+ Players velocity is now added to thrown knife velocities.

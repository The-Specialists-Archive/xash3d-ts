Copyright stuff: First and foremost, at least 1/4th of my map is covered in textures created for non-profit use by Remedy Entertainment Ltd. Most, if not all, of the textures here are for non-profit, credited use, and I sincerely hope that I gave proper credit where it is due. Please email me if I forgot to include you. 

ALSO! Don't call this level your own. Because it's not. :-/ 
If anything, distribute this text file along with the bsp. 
Any sounds or sprites that you found included with this map, feel free to use. 
If you happen to use the ones with the "LMD" prefix, go ahead and email me 
so I can see how your work turns out. There are also some textures imbedded into the map. 
If you manage to get them out (via Quark or decompiling), the ones that
I made have the prefix "OM" or "LMD" attatched to them. Go ahead and use those also.
